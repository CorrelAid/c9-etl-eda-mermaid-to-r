Track ETL Challenge 9 - Mermaid to Logic
================

# Issue
CfN researchers (note: non-technical staff with limited coding expertise) use Mermaid diagrams to define the operationalization of outcome variables (‘Diversitätsprofil’). For calculating these outcome variables, they use a seperate, hard-coded R script. We want to streamline this process! 

# Goal
Translation of information from Mermaid diagrams into YAML-style data structures. (note: Team 7 (ETL - Transform) already wrote a Python script to automatically calculate the outcome variables based on YAML-style data structures). No more separate, hard-coded R scripts. 

# Solutions 

1. Use a predefined Mermaid style guide to create the mermaid diagrams.
2. Write code in Python or R to transfer the Mermaid code to a YAML-style data structure.
